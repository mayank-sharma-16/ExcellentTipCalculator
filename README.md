## Notes

As someone who has not previously dealt with Swift/Objective-C or mobile app development (aside from a brief stint back in high school with
Android Studio), I began this project at square one with both; thus, while basic functionality was achieved at the 
requirement level, and there are some attempts at adding additional features, there are improvements that I would like to 
have made if I had more time, such as a robust settings customization and a history log that shows how often the user tips 
and at what percentage across any time period the user chooses. Understanding the hierarchy of the controllers and views was 
tricky when it came to best practices as opposed to having something that simply worked, so if I could do this over, I would
spend more time exploring that hierarchy.
